Pluralsight - Introduction to Sequelize ORM for Node

## Acknowledgments

- **Patrick Schroeder** who taught this helpful Sequelize ORM course available on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/sequelize-orm-nodejs-introduction/table-of-contents)

## Description

Re-created a Sequelize ORM implementation within an Angular application using MySQL for the back end database. Models were created for users, books, and reading lists (a many-to-many relationship). Controller methods were modified to use **async / await**.

### Note

This app runs on localhost and has not been configured for deployment.

### Installing

After downloading, run `npm install` and then `npm start` which will run a custom `ng serve` command using `nodemon` for the back end.

## Built With

- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) - Promise-based Node.js ORM
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server Framework
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Application Framework
